  ## Description
  **Here is a short description of this project:**
   This is a readme generator CLI, taking in user input and creating a README based on that
  
  **My motivation for making this was:**
  As a user, I wanted a quick way to create my readme to make the steps of creating future projects more efficient
  
  **Some challenges I faced were:**
  Getting the right prompts to really round out what I wanted to portray in any given readme, and making sure all the bases were covered.
